# PIC32Matrix
Driver for the RGB LED Matrix in PIC32(Tested only in Uno32)
Pinout can be found at the top of ledpixel.h
Tested with P4 and P5 32x64 matrix

Code can be optimized but we decided that we wanted to write a readable code because of the lack of datasheet and information how the matrix works.
